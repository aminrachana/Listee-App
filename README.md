<h3>JS/XML Assignment (APIs, Node.JS, Pug)</h3>

<p>For the JS/XML Project, I have made a website for the Travelling Information e.g. It will show the information that you need regarding Hotels and Popular attractions near by the City that you have search.</p>
<p>The List of Hotels with information of it can get from API, here I have used https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/tripadvisor16 to get list of Hotels by their City name.</p>
<p>We can also find the popular attractions below the hotel information. This list of popular attractions can get from the API - https://rapidapi.com/opentripmap/api/places1/ .</p>
